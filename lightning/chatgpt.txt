Suppose that a robot can make discrete step sizes in the set {s1,s2,...} 
and it needs to walk a distance d. Give an algorithm for the robot 
to travel distance d using the minimum number of steps

Answer: To travel a distance d using the minimum number of steps, the robot can use the following algorithm:

Sort the set of step sizes {s1, s2, …} in descending order.
Initialize a variable i to 1.
Initialize a variable n to 0.
While d > 0: a. If d >= si, then subtract si from d and add 1 to n. b. Otherwise, increment i.
Return n.
This algorithm works by choosing the largest step size that is less than or equal to
 the remaining distance d at each step. By choosing the largest step size first, 
 the algorithm minimizes the number of steps needed to travel the distance d.

Question: given a set of bricks with variety of heights, with possible duplicates, 
you need to stack a subset of the bricks on top of each other to reach a given height H.
 Give me an algorithm that minimizes the number of bricks

 Answer: To minimize the number of bricks required to reach a given height H, 
 we can use dynamic programming. We can create an array dp of size H+1 
 where dp[i] represents the minimum number of bricks required to reach the height i. 
 We can initialize dp[0] to 0 and all other elements to infinity. 
 We can then iterate over the bricks and for each brick j, we can update the dp array as follows:

for j in bricks:
    for i in range(j, H+1):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-j]+1)
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(H * n) where n is the number of bricks.


question: The UK coin denomination system 1p,2p,5p,10p,20p,50p,1£,2£ is said to be canonical
 because given a monetary amount K, one can find the minimum number of coins that add up to K 
 by following a greedy strategy: always choose the largest coin smaller or equal to the remaining amount.
  For example 9p=5p+2p+2p. But if one includes a 25p coin, the greedy strategy 
  no longer works since for K=40 greedy would need 3 coins (25+10+5) whereas 
  the minimum is 2 (20+20). Given an integer amount K and 
  an array v representing the denomination system (v=[1,2,5,10,20,50,100,200] for UK coins), 
  devise an efficient algorithm that finds the minimum number of coins that 
  add up to K for any type of denomination. What is the time complexity of your algorithm?


  Answer: This is an interesting problem. The greedy algorithm works for the UK coin denomination system 
  because the coins are in a canonical order. However, if we add a 25p coin, 
  the greedy algorithm no longer works.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. 
We can create an array dp of size K+1 where dp[i] represents the minimum number of coins
 required to make the amount i. We can initialize dp[0] to 0 and all other elements to infinity. 
 We can then iterate over the denomination array v and for each coin j in v, 
 we can update the dp array as follows:

for j in v:
    for i in range(j, K+1):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-j]+1)
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(K * n) where n is the length of the denomination array v.
